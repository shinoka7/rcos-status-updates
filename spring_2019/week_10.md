Added endpoint generation and subscription to be automated now. So even if the user
is using 2 different browsers, setting notifications for each browser will push seperate 
notifications specific to that browser, where now the system authenticates the subscription
based on the actual endpoint, not the user's device. Now the feature is completely implemented.

Run a some more tests to check for specific cases that can happen.
Adjust notifications based on each stop. Certain stops are further to get to
from residential or waiting areas, so depending on the user's location the notification
can adjusted to notify based on factors like the user's distance from the stop.
