Fixed the Shuttle Route bug. Added error popups for when inserted info is in incorrect format.
Added functionality to store and manage times selected by user and cleaned up more the UI.
Finished up the overall frontend for notification registration, and is ready to be combined with backend,
although this feature will need a change in design direction due to usability.
Started working on push notifications for desktop browsers. Added permission request for push notifications.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Implement push notification enable depending on user input (switch) and disable based on
the shuttle passing by. If there are no shuttles and the eta is empty, push notification
will be disabled also. Test the feature locally.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

Can't access admin panel locally, which blocks testing.
