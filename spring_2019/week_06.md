## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

Added functionality to the 'submit' button, where now it will check for the correct inputs. Although the 'submit' button is disabled without data
for certain inputs (which are constricted inputs), it still checks for potentially buggy-ness.
Changed the design for input type 'route' from checkbox to radio, to avoid potential
holes in the time selection design. Added functionality to parse the stop_id from url to
later on use.
