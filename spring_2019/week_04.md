## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

Changed the language used for the interactive table to html for dependency purposes. Found a local bug relating to accessing other components based on raw url, and been looking to fix it. << Found out that the go build wasn't compiling, due to having a older version of Go. Made the stop popups have links that fly to the register component.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Update Go version. Clean install of the latest version of shuttletracker and merge my recent files to this. Add handling to the link events for the stop popups, to make the links specify the route and stop for the register page.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

Nothing at all.
