## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions
Fixed local bugs with Postgres installations, regarding installation location. Added to the frontend registration component, but probably will use other teammate's version. Looked up and learned about potential external libraries we can use for an interactive table for the time specification. 


## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices
Implement interactive table to the registration page, consisting of days of the week and times of the day. Thinking of making the time intervals every 10 min which will result in a rather large table. Therefore, considering of adding more flexible to usability, which will be implemented later but will be set up it so.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
Nothing really.
