## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

Cleaned up alot of the UI. Made the time schedule look nicer, got rid of the sorting
functionality to it. Got rid of the dragging functionality of the time table because
of the realization that this is rather not needed. Made the Selected times table display
the specific times selected by the user. Added an Event bus to later be able to share more
data between components. Added options to carrier types dropdown. Fixed a few bugs there were
in display (tabulator related).

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices

Fix Shuttle Route bug, where currently it isn't initialized by default depending on the
stop. Add span text for error messages based on input when submitting user info (whenever
it gets caught on an error test). Add functionality to store and manage the times selected
by user.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology

Currently only showing times by hour, but design-wise this will be a problem later on.
Need to figure out how we will display more specific times(every 20 min or so).

## Notes
