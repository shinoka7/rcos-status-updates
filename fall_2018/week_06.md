## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions
	
	Added Component 'register.vue' and implemented some of the layout
	Still everything is basic simple, bad UI, but added functionality so that
	I can start on the backend. Currently haven't implemented a calendar UI,
	so that will be a potential later issue that needs to be attacked on the
	frontend side.
	
	
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices
	
	Finish up register.vue implementation
	Start to look into how to implement backend.
	Still a bit confused, so learn more about how the shuttletracker functions
	on the backend side.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.
