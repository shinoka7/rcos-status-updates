## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions
	
	Added dropdowns for scheduling the notification. Initially the idea was to use
	a calendar UI for this but because of time running short and backend needing to
	be implemented as well, will keep the frontend simple for the time being. Started to
	look into how the shuttletracker is actually run, what is connected where and how it's
	kept updated.
	
## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> Examples: New Bugs to be fixed, Design choices
	
	Haven't been able to run shuttletracker locally so need to fix to test new features
	Finish implementing functionality to the component to connect to backend.
	

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
	
	Limited experience with Typescript.
